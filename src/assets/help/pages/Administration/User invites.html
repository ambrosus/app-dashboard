<h1>User invites</h1>

<p>The only way for users to create accounts within the dashboard, they need to be first invited by dashboard's owner or admin.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In administration page > invite tab, owner or admin can send one or multiple invites.</li>
  <li>For each invite, inviter can set:
    <ul>
      <li>AccessLevel - Hermes Node accessLevel giving user ability to create assets/events with different level of privacy.</li>
      <li>Role - Each role has array of specific permissions, ie. admin can manage users (within the dashboard) and create assets and events, whereas normal user can only view and create assets and events.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Additional to the email for each invite, inviter can set a message to be sent with the invites.</li>
  <li>Once sent, sent/not yet used invites, can be managed inside of the invites tab, where owner or admin can revoke one or more invites.</li>
</ul>
