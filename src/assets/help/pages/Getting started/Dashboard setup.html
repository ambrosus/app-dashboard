<h1>Dashboard setup</h1>

<p>On first installment of the dashboard, person installing the dashboard goes through couple of steps to configure it.</p>
<p>Dashboard (at the moment), is working against one specific hermes node (ie. https://gateway-test.ambrosus.com). Furthermore, dashboard has one owner who has all the permissions and manages all the users and activities in the dashboard.</p>
<h4>Steps are as follows:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Hermes Node information</li>
  <li>Company running the dashboard information</li>
  <li>Owners information</li>
  <li>On successful setup, new account is created for the owner. Owner gets address and secret which are registered within specified Hermes Node. This pair of address and secret are stored nowhere for security reasons, thus we recommend to save them in a safe place. Regardless, owner can login with his email and password.</li>
</ol>
