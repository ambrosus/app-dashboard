<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>At the moment there is one centerlized Ambrosus dashboard.</p>
<p>There are 3 different deployment versions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://dashboard-dev.ambrosus.com">Dev</a>: for developing new app features.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dashboard-test.ambrosus.com">Test</a>: for testing new features.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dashboard.ambrosus.com">Production</a>: production version.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dashboard is initially setup against a specific Ambrosus hermes node (ie. https://gateway-test.ambrosus.com), along with the owner of the dashboard.</p>
<p>To get a user account, dashboard's owner or admin need to send an invite to one or more users. Upon receiving an invite in the email, user can follow the link in the email and create an account.</p>
<p>With the new account, depending on role user has, he can create new assets, events, view all the assets created by him...</p>
<p>Features are explained in more detail in following questions.</p>
