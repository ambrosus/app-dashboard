<h1>Create an asset</h1>

<p>Two ways to create an asset within the dashboard:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Regular form</li>
  <li>JSON form</li>
</ol>

<p>To create an asset, of course, user doesn't have to know any of the details explained in <a href="/help/Assets/What are assets">what are assets</a>, rather it's easily done using regular or JSON form, which creates an asset and info event describing the asset automatically.</p>
<p>On /assets page, click on a <b>Create asset</b> button on the right side in table's header.</p>

<h3>Regular form</h3>

<p>Options</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic info: assetType, name and description</li>
  <li>Asset images (one or more)</li>
  <li>Asset identifiers: GTIN, GLN, QR... (one or more)</li>
  <li>Any other custom information, formated as:
    <ul>
      <li>Key-value:
        <code>Origin: ...</code>
      </li>
      <li>Group information:
        <code>Product information:
  size: ...
  weight: ...
  expiration date: ...
  brand: ....</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regular form process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates an asset.</li>
  <li>Creates an event of type <b>ambrosus.asset.info</b>, which holds all the descriptive information about the asset, and attaches the event to the asset.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JSON form</h3>

<p>In JSON form, user can just upload or insert a template of an asset with multiple events attached to it, and this form will create a new asset with the same events and information in them attached to the asset.</p>
<p>Where the creator of the asset and its events is set as the current logged in user, using the form.</p>
