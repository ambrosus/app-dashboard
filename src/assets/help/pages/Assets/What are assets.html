<h1>What are assets</h1>

<blockquote>
  Assets are primary elements moving through a supply chain. The are the nouns of the system. They can represent an ingredient, product, package of products or any other type of container.
</blockquote>

<p>Each asset represents a specific entity (ingredient, product..), and in Hermes Node it's represented as set of specific details.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<code>
  {
    "assetId": "0xc5cfd04.....30755ed65",
      "content": {
      "signature": "0x30755ed65396facf86c53e6...65c5cfd04be400",
      "idData": {
        "createdBy": "0x162a44701727a31f457a53801cd181cd38eb5bbd",
        "timestamp": 1503424923,
        "sequenceNumber": 3
      }
    }
  }
</code>

<p>Each asset, can have multiple events describing the assets current state, location, etc. (produced, shipped, sold)</p>
