<h1>View assets/asset</h1>

<p>User can view all the assets created by him.</p>
<p>Each asset page, displays all the descriptive information about the asset (if that asset has <b>ambrosus.asset.info</b> event), and all the events on the right side within the timeline.</p>
<p>Additionally, each asset page generates a QR code image which can be downloaded, and which leads to amb.to preview of the asset.</p>

<blockquote>
  amb.to is a preview app for assets in AMB network. All the events that are displayed within the dashboard include both public and private events, where as amb.to only displays public events.
