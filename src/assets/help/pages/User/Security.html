<h1>Security</h1>

<p>In settings > security tab, besides password change form, user can see the list of all the devices current account is logged in.</p>

<blockquote>
  On each login user session is created and stored in the browser, meaning no one can pretend to be a specific user in order to hack users account. Using sessions is a secure way to handle login process.
</blockquote>

<p>Each session describes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device type</li>
  <li>Operating system</li>
  <li>Browser</li>
</ul>

<p>On logout session on that device is deleted.</p>
<p>If user forgot to logout from different devices, for more security user can logout of all those devices inside of the dashboard.</p>
<p>To logout of the current session (current browser), there's a logout button in the top right menu (by click on users name or picture).</p>
