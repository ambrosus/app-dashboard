<h1>Edit events</h1>

<p>
  All data uploaded to the blockchain is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified or deleted. That means events can't really be edited,
  but we call it edit, as once user clicks on <b>edit event</b> button on event page, form gets prefilled with current event information and on save,
  it actually creates a new event with same event type as edited event.
</p>

<p>For example, <b>ambrosus.asset.info</b> event specifically is the first event created, when user creates an asset using dashboard.
  That event holds all the descriptive information about the asset (images, description, etc.). Dashboard and amb.to in particular only display the latest version of that event type.
  Which means once we edit that event using dashboard, it creates a new event of the same type (ambrosus.asset.info), but with edited information, which is then as latest event of that type displayed.</p>
