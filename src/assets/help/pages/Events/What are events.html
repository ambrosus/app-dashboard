<h1>What are events</h1>

<blockquote>
  Events describe all registered changes of state that occurred with the asset. E.g. measured temperature, noted big acceleration or changing pallets.
</blockquote>

<p>Each asset, can have multiple events describing the assets current state, location, etc. (produced, shipped, sold)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<code>
  {
    "eventId": "0x8c1aebc.....6a7ef268e"
    "content": {
        "signature": "0x30755ed65396facf86c53e6...65c5cfd04be400",
        "idData": {
            "assetId": "0xc5cfd04.....30755ed65",
            "createdBy": "0x162a44701727a31f457a53801cd181cd38eb5bbd",
            "accessLevel": 4,
            "timestamp": 1503424923,
            "dataHash": "0x01cd181cd38eb5bbd162a44701727a31f457a538"
        },
        "data": [
            {
              "type": "ambrosus.event.customevent",
              "customField": "customValue"
            }
        ]

    }
}

<p>Here is one of the JSON <a href="/assets/chocolate.json" download>examples of an asset with multiple events</a>.</p>

<p>Of course to create an event/events in the dashboard this knowledge above isn't necessary.</p>
