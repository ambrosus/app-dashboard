<h2 style="margin: 20px 0 40px;">Securing Your Private Keys</h2>
<p>
  Use hardware wallets to keep your private keys safe. A hardware wallet is a flash drive like device, designed specifically for storing your keys. These are HD wallets that generate private and public keys via mnemonic phrase or seed words when initialized. Some popular hardware devices that are used and trusted are Ledger Nano S and Trezor.
  Never keep private keys online, in a mail or in the cloud. There they are most susceptible to getting obtained by bad actors.
</p>
<p>
  If you donâ€™t have a hardware wallet, you can temporarily keep your private keys or seed in an offline flash drive or HDD. These options are only safe as long as they are not in the hands of an attacker. One can also use offline drives that encrypt the data stored on them. This way you can add one more security layer for accessing your account.
  If there is no possibility to obtain a hardware wallet, the other option is paper wallet. A paper wallet is a piece of paper that prints the pair of private and public keys on it. To make it more secure, you can laminate it and store it in a vault.
</p>
<p>
  Never take a screenshot or picture of your private keys. It becomes easily obtainable by bad actors once they get access to your device. Instead, consider various cold storage solutions.
