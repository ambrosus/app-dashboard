<h1>Viewing and creating events</h1>

<p>You can view the events and add new ones by navigating to the specific page of the asset of interest.</p>

<p>To create a new event, click on <i>“Create Event”</i>. You will have two ways to add event data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The user-friendly input form (default). Use it to simply fill out all the necessary fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another, a rather technical way, is to use a JSON-formatted text (<a href="https://www.json.org/" target="_blank">read more</a>).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once the fields are filled out, click <i>“Create”</i>. If all the information you entered is valid, you will see a progress bar indicating the upload status.</p>
