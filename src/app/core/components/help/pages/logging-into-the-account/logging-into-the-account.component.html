<h1>Logging into the account</h1>

<p>There are two ways you can access your account in the Dashboard:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Use the private key that you registered with Ambrosus. Initially, this will be the only way you can log into the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you are in, you can go to your personal account settings, set a password and “Save”. Next time, you can use your e-mail and password to access the account.
  </li>
</ol>
